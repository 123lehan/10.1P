 Project Description

This project demonstrates the implementation of monitoring and visibility for a cloud-native application deployed on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). The application itself is a Dockerized Node.js calculator API that performs basic arithmetic operations and logs each calculation to a connected MongoDB database. After deploying the application to GKE using Kubernetes manifests, observability was achieved by configuring Google Cloud’s built-in tools—Cloud Monitoring and Cloud Logging. Logs Explorer was used to collect, filter, and display real-time logs from the running containers. These logs provided insight into application startup behavior, MongoDB connectivity, and endpoint interactions such as `/add`, `/subtract`, and `/history`. By observing container-level logs directly from the Kubernetes cluster, the setup enabled effective troubleshooting and operational visibility into how the application was functioning inside the cluster.

To enhance observability further, a custom monitoring dashboard was created using Google Cloud Monitoring. The dashboard was configured to track two key performance indicators: CPU usage time and memory usage of the `task42c-calculator-api` container. These metrics were sourced from Kubernetes container resources and filtered using container name and cluster-specific labels to isolate data relevant to the deployed microservice. Each chart provided a clear view of how the application was utilizing system resources over time, enabling live tracking of performance patterns. The combination of detailed logs and metric visualizations created a reliable monitoring layer that reflects best practices for managing containerized workloads in production environments. This setup not only meets the task requirements but also demonstrates a real-world, scalable approach to cloud-native application observability using GCP’s operations suite.
